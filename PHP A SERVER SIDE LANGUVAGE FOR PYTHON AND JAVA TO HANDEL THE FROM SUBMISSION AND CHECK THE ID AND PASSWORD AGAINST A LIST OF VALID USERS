Here’s the code we’re analyzing: 
```php
<?php
// This PHP code is responsible for managing the login process.
// It's just for demonstration; in a real-world scenario, you'd use a database.

$students = array(
    "student101" => "pass101",
    "student102" => "pass102",
    "student103" => "pass103",
    "student104" => "pass104",
    "student105" => "pass105"
);

// Check if the form was submitted via POST
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Retrieve the student ID and password from the form
    $submitted_id = $_POST["student_id"];
    $submitted_password = $_POST["password"];

    // Verify if the submitted ID exists in our array
    if (array_key_exists($submitted_id, $students)) {
        // Check if the provided password matches the one stored
        if ($students[$submitted_id] == $submitted_password) {
            // Successful login!
            echo "<h1>Welcome, " . htmlspecialchars($submitted_id) . "!</h1>";
            echo "<p>You have successfully logged in.</p>";
            // In a real application, you'd start a session here and redirect the user
        } else {
            // Password is incorrect
            echo "<h1>Login Failed</h1>";
            echo "<p>Oops! The password you entered is incorrect. Please try again.</p>";
            // You could provide a link back to the login page
            echo "<a href='login.html'>Return to login page</a>";
        }
    } else {
        // Student ID not found
        echo "<h1>Login Failed</h1>";
        echo "<p>Sorry, we couldn't find that Student ID. Please try again.</p>";
        // You could provide a link back to the login page
        echo "<a href='login.html'>Return to login page</a>";
    }
